# CloudPiano 
By Matthew Swartz for TribeHacksIII

Grabs the local doppler image and converts it into a midi file

Running CloudPiano.py will automatically grab the .gif of the latest doppler image 
as generated by the National Weather Service for GIS purposes and convert it into 
a .mid file

CloudPiano will create both the gif and the MIDI file in its folder for access
and timestamp the filename

The project also contains fuctions for gerenating different types of MIDI song from the same source file by running
that function in the programs main area instead of the default

CloudPiano also contains code that can be quickly repurposed by changing the path of what image it is fed
in order to convert images (.gif and .png support) into MIDI files
